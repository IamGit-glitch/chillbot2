Some tips to get you started :)
- TL;DR: no gifs & fewer channels until you have reached the first star ‚≠ê rank role
- you gain the ‚≠ê roles by being active and sending messages on the server

type !rank in <#878901585709789204> to check your progress
type !lvlroles in <#878901585709789204> to see all the roles and their amounts

        `;

        // Attempt to send the DM to the new member
        member.send(welcomeMessage).catch((error) => {
            console.error(`Could not send DM to ${member.user.tag}. Error:`, error);
        });
    },
